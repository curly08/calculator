# Cool Calculator

This is my final project for the foundations section of The Odin Project. This project required me to combine everything I've learned so far to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It even includes keyboard support! Check it out [here](https://curly08.github.io/calculator/). The project details can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator).
